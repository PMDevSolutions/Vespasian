/**
 * Product manifest — the typed descriptor the GUI engine renders a product from.
 *
 * This is the seam that turns the shell from "the Vespasian app" into a generic
 * engine: the engine (core + main + the renderer shell) reads *what to show and
 * what to run* from a ProductManifest, and the only product-specific knowledge
 * lives in the per-product manifest object (see ./vespasian). A second product
 * (Aurelius, Nerva, …) is added by supplying another manifest — not by editing
 * the engine. See docs/GUI-PLATFORM.md.
 *
 * It deliberately speaks the vocabulary the engine already uses — TaskKind,
 * SiteCommand, QaScript, PipelineKind — rather than inventing a parallel
 * language. A manifest is PURE, SERIALIZABLE DATA (no functions, no node
 * imports) so it is safe to import from the sandboxed renderer as well as
 * from main/preload; behaviour (building a RunSpec, parsing output) is bound in
 * core via the typed keys below.
